* Introduction

=dired-image-thumbnail= is an Emacs package that extends =image-dired= with an enhanced workflow inspired by =dired-video-thumbnail=. It adds powerful sorting, filtering, subdirectory management, and flexible display options to the standard =image-dired= thumbnail viewer.

* Features

- *Sorting* - Sort thumbnails by name, date, size, or image dimensions
- *Filtering* - Filter by name regexp, file size range, or dimension range
- *Subdirectory support* - Works seamlessly with Dired's inserted subdirectories
- *Subdirectory helpers* - Commands to quickly insert/remove subdirectories
- *Wrap display mode* - Thumbnails flow naturally and wrap to window width
- *Enhanced header line* - Shows current image info, dimensions, sort/filter status
- *Full integration* - Works seamlessly with existing =image-dired= functionality
- *Transient menus* - Optional transient.el integration for discoverability

* Requirements

- Emacs 28.1 or later
- =image-dired= (built-in)
- =transient= (optional, for transient menu support)

* Installation

** Manual

Download =dired-image-thumbnail.el= and place it in your load-path:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/dired-image-thumbnail/")
(require 'dired-image-thumbnail)
#+end_src

** use-package

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package dired-image-thumbnail
  :load-path "/path/to/dired-image-thumbnail/"
  :demand t)
#+end_src

** straight.el

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package
 '(dired-image-thumbnail :type git :host github :repo "captainflasmr/dired-image-thumbnail"))
#+end_src

* Usage

** Quick Start

The simplest way to use =dired-image-thumbnail= is from a Dired buffer:

1. Navigate to a directory containing images
2. Press =C-t d= (or =C-t m=) to view thumbnails
3. Use the enhanced keybindings for sorting, filtering, etc.

** Working with Subdirectories

=dired-image-thumbnail= works with Dired's subdirectory insertion feature. You have several options:

*** Manual insertion
Use Dired's built-in =i= (=dired-maybe-insert-subdir=) on any subdirectory to make its contents visible, then run =dired-image-thumbnail=.

*** Helper commands
- =C-t s= (=dired-image-thumbnail-insert-image-subdirs=) - Insert only subdirectories containing images (recommended)
- =C-t z= (=dired-image-thumbnail-insert-subdir-recursive=) - Insert all subdirectories
- =C-t k= (=dired-image-thumbnail-kill-all-subdirs=) - Remove all inserted subdirectories

** From Standard image-dired

You can also use the standard =image-dired= commands (=C-t d=, =C-t a=, etc.) - =dired-image-thumbnail= automatically enhances the thumbnail buffer with new keybindings.

* Header Line

The enhanced header line displays:

- *Mark indicator* - A =*= if the current image is marked
- *Filename* - Relative to source directory when subdirectories are inserted
- *Image count* - Current position / total (e.g., =23/156=)
- *Dimensions* - Width × Height in pixels (e.g., =1920x1080=)
- *File size* - Human-readable size (e.g., =2.4M=)
- *Sort indicator* - Current sort field and direction (e.g., =[name ↑]=)
- *Active filters* - Description of any active filters
- *Marked count* - Number of marked images (e.g., =[3 marked]=)

* Customization

All customization options are in the =dired-image-thumbnail= group. Use =M-x customize-group RET dired-image-thumbnail RET= to browse them interactively.

** Default Sort Settings

#+end_src

** Display Options

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq dired-image-thumbnail-wrap-display nil)   ; Enable wrap display by default
#+end_src

Add or modify recognized image file extensions:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq dired-image-thumbnail-image-extensions
      '("jpg" "jpeg" "png" "gif" "bmp" "tiff" "tif" "webp" "svg" "ico" "heic" "heif"))
#+end_src

                (image-dired default-directory)
                (dired-image-thumbnail-refresh)))
   ("C-t m" . dired-image-thumbnail)
   ("C-t s" . dired-image-thumbnail-insert-image-subdirs)

#+end_src

* Workflow Examples

** Reviewing a Photo Collection

1. Open directory in Dired: =C-x d ~/Photos RET=
2. Insert subdirectories with images: =C-t s=
3. View thumbnails: =C-t m=
4. Sort by date (newest first): =s d= then =s r=
5. Browse with =n= / =p= or arrow keys
6. Mark keepers with =m=, jump to Dired with =d=

** Finding Large Images

1. View thumbnails: =C-t m=
2. Filter by size: =/ s= and enter =1M= for minimum, leave maximum empty
3. Sort by size (largest first): =s s= then =s r=
4. Review and mark images, delete with =x=

** Finding High-Resolution Images

1. View thumbnails: =C-t m=
2. Filter by dimensions: =/ d= and enter minimum width =1920=, minimum height =1080=
3. Browse only HD+ images
4. Use =/ c= to clear the filter when done

** Working with Subdirectories

1. Open parent directory in Dired
2. Use =C-t s= to insert only subdirectories containing images (fast)
3. Or use =C-t z= to insert all subdirectories (may be slow with many dirs)
4. View thumbnails with =C-t m=
5. Images from all visible subdirectories will be shown
6. Use =C-t k= to remove all subdirectories and return to top-level view

** Organizing by Date

1. Open directory in Dired
2. Insert subdirectories if needed: =C-t s=
3. View thumbnails: =C-t m=
4. Sort by date: =s d=
5. Use the header line to see file dates as you browse

* Comparison with Standard image-dired

| Transient menus        | ✗           | ✓ (optional)          |

* Transient Menu Support

If =transient= is available, =dired-image-thumbnail= provides interactive menus for sorting and filtering. These can be accessed with:

- =S= - Sort menu (shows all sort options and current state)
- =\= - Filter menu (shows all filter options and current filters)

To disable transient menus even when transient is installed, don't load =dired-image-thumbnail-transient.el=.

* Performance Notes

** Subdirectory Insertion

When working with large directory trees:

- Use =dired-image-thumbnail-insert-image-subdirs= (=C-t s=) instead of =dired-image-thumbnail-insert-subdir-recursive= (=C-t z=)
- The "smart" insertion only processes subdirectories containing images, which is much faster
- For very large collections, manually insert specific subdirectories with =i= as needed

** Thumbnail Generation

First-time thumbnail generation can be slow for large images. Thumbnails are cached by =image-dired=, so subsequent viewing is fast.

* Troubleshooting

** Images not appearing

- Ensure =image-dired= is working: test with =C-t d= in a directory with images
- Check that file extensions are in =dired-image-thumbnail-image-extensions=
- Verify thumbnails are being created in =image-dired-dir=

** Subdirectories not showing images

- Ensure subdirectories are actually inserted in the Dired buffer (use =i= or helper commands)
- Check that =dired-image-thumbnail-insert-image-subdirs= found subdirectories (watch for message)
- Verify files in subdirectories have recognized image extensions

** Slow performance with many directories

- Use =C-t s= (insert image subdirs only) instead of =C-t z= (insert all subdirs)
- Manually insert specific subdirectories with =i= as needed
- Consider filtering to reduce the number of visible thumbnails
